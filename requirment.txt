This is the final output I want, a pdf with the result sheet as shown here:
https://inecelectionresults.ng/elections/63f8f25b594e164f8146a213/pu/63f8f28b594e164f8146a3b5/document 
Presidential Elections: 
https://inecelectionresults.ng/pres/elections/63f8f25b594e164f8146a213?type=pres 
However, It drills down from here: https://inecelectionresults.ng/elections/types 

Would need a table with the data like you just gave me, 
but with a link to download the pdf, 
and also a script way to download all the pdfs uploaded at once with the polling units number
as the file name.

Also a script where I can download all the pdfs on my computer, 
so the script should download the files and put them in 
folders like STATE > LGA > WARD > POLLING UNIT > 01-01-01-001-Resultsheet.pdf
